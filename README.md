## 🚦 Understanding the Project
This project illustrates the principles of networking and security. You will find multiple routers, switches, and devices configured to demonstrate:

- **GRE Tunnels:** These provide a way to encapsulate network protocols.
- **EIGRP Dynamic Routing:** This protocol helps determine the best path for data transmission.
- **Centralized DHCP:** This allows for automatic IP addressing in a secure manner.
- **Extended Access Control Lists:** These help to filter traffic based on specific criteria.
- **Hub-and-Spoke VPN Topology:** Clearly define how data travels between the head office and branch offices securely.

## ⚙️ Basic Usage Tips
- Familiarize yourself with Cisco Packet Tracer. There are many online tutorials available for beginners.
- Experiment with the configurations to see how changes affect connectivity and security.
